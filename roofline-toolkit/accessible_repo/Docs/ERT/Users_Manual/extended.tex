This tool's uses could be extended to run user's kernels (and drivers).  It
basically forms a software harness that runs a code with a variety of
compilations and a variety of MPI processes, OpenMP threads, and Cuda/GPU
thread-blocks and threads-per-block, stores the results of the runs, and
compiles information about specific runs and the overall set of runs.

In future releases of the ERT, more details of the internal formats and
processing will be documented so extending the ERT and using if for more
general purposes will be simplified.  In addition, more drivers and kernels
will be released to cover a broader range of test codes.
