The source code in the RooflineViewPart subdirectory comprises an Eclipse project. In addition to generating the standalone jar for the Roofline Visualizer this project may be used to build an Eclipse plug-in which will incorporate the visualizer into an Eclipse workspace. This functionality relies on the E(fx)clipse project to add JavaFX integration support and the Eclipse C Development Tools (CDT) SDK to provide C/C++ project integration. Eclipse integration is not yet officially supported. Please contact Wyatt Spear at wspear@cs.uoregon.edu with any issues or questions about building/running the Visualizer.
