### Part 1: Matrix-matrix Multiplication

1. Code for matrix multiplication.  

2. For a given matrix size _N_, the total number of floating point operations performed by matrix multiplication is _N^2(2N-1)_.  

3. Performance in Mflop/s for _N_=100 is ``.

5. Run experiments on matrices whose size _N_ ranges from 1 to 10,000,000.   
Plot to show Gflop/s vs. _N_, with a horizontal line representing the theoritical peak performance.  



6. The hardware architecture is ...  
Compared to the theoretical peak performance, the performance we measured in (5) ...  
Features in our plot...    
(hint: Pay particular attention to the comparison between different architectures and give explanations for them.)
